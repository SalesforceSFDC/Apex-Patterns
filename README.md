* The `global` access modifier, which is more permissive than the `public` modifier and allows access across namespaces and applications.

## List
You can add elements to a list when creating the list, or after creating the list by calling the add() method. 
* Create a list and add elements to it:
```apex
List<String> colors = new List<String> {'red', 'blue'};

//Add elements to list after it has been created
List<String>  moreColors = new List<String>();
moreColors.add('orange');

```
* List syntax: `List<Data Type> variable name = new List<Data Type>();`

* List elements can be read by specifying an index between square brackets, just like with array elements. Also, you can use the get() method to read a list element.

```apex
// Get elements from a list
String color1 = moreColors.get(0);
String color2 = moreColors[0];
System.assertEquals(color1, color2);

//iterate over a list to read elements
for(Integer i=0; i<colors.size(); i++) {
    //write value to the debug log
    System.debug(colors[i]);
}
```

## Apex Class Definition
All objects have a state and a behavior, things that objects know about itself and things that an object can do.
Variables are used to specify the state of an object, such as the object's Name or Type.  

A class can contain other classes, exception types, and initialization code.

An interface is like a class in which none of the methods have been implementedâ€”the method signatures are there, but the body of each method is empty. To use an interface, another class must implement it by providing a body for all of the methods contained in the interface.

Methods are used to control behavior, such as getOtherQuotes or copyLineItems.

To define a class, specify the following:
* Access modifiers:
    * Must use one of the access modifiers (such as `public` or `global`) in the declaration of the top-level class.
    * You do not have to use an access modifier in the declaration of an inner level class.
* Optional definition modifiers (`virtual`, `abstract`, etc.)
* Required: The keyword `class` followed by the name of the class.
* Optional extensions and/or implementations

Syntax to define a class:
```apex
private | public | global 
[virtual | abstract | with sharing | without sharing]
class ClassName [implements InterfaceNameList] [extends ClassName]
{
    //the body of the class
}
```
* The `virtual` definition modifier declares that this class allows extension and overrides. You cannot override a method with the `override` keyword unless the class has been defined as `virtual`.
* The `abstract` definition modifier declares that this class contains abstract methods, that is, methods that only have their signature declared and no body defined.
